* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are using different devices or workstations to work on your project and when switching you haven't really have done anything worthy of a commit, but did some work on it that you still don't want to loose. It needs to be accessible from anywhere.
Or when working on a project together with other people that also need access to your current file?
